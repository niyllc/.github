# Contributing

Welcome fellow software developer ðŸ˜€ Please read this short & self-explainitory and read our[Code Of Conduct](https://github.com/niyllc/.github/blob/main/docs/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before you start contributing.

### Starting To Code

We know that you have a wonderful idea that will support our project. First, you need to clone the repository that you want to work in to your computer. You can do this by using the [Git Products](https://git-scm.com/) or using the Github Desktop. Write your beautiful chunk of code and go to the next step!

### Testing Your Code

All of the codes are perfect but they should not break our system. Make sure you apply the test before you commit and create a pull request. First, run the tests. If it crashes, try to fix the code. If it doesn't go ahead and commit it!
